**Health Program Comparison**
Description: Developed a Python program to compare health programs in schools A and B. Analyzed height, weight, and age data to determine which class had better health outcomes.
Technologies: Python, statistics module

Features:
•	Input: Received student data for each class.
•	Calculation: Calculated average age, height, and weight for each class using statistics.
•	Comparison: Identified the class with the best health results based on average height and weight.
Achievements:
•	Utilized OOP principles to create an efficient data analysis program.
•	Demonstrated problem-solving skills by handling cases with equal averages.
•	Showcased proficiency in Python and data analysis using essential libraries.

**Age Calculator**
Built a Python program using datetime to accurately calculate a person's age based on their input birthdate (yyyy/mm/dd). The program validates the date format and handles invalid cases gracefully by displaying "WRONG" in the output.
Tools: Python, datetime library

Features:
•	Input: Accepts user's birthdate in yyyy/mm/dd format.
•	Validation: Ensures correct date format and valid date components (year, month, day).
•	Age Calculation: Utilizes datetime to accurately calculate the age.
•	Error Handling: Displays "WRONG" for incorrect input or invalid dates.
Achievements:
•	Developed a concise age calculator program using Python and datetime.
•	Implemented robust input validation and error handling.
•	Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming and datetime operations.

**Football Player Team Assignment**
Developed a Python program to randomly assign 22 football players to Team A and Team B. Using OOP and the random module, the program ensures each team has exactly 12 players, displaying the player names and their respective teams as the final output.

Tools: Python, random module

Features:
•	Input: Accepts football player names as input in a specified format.
•	Random Assignment: Utilizes randomization and OOP to assign players to Team A or Team B.
•	Team Balance: Ensures each team has precisely 12 players.
•	Output: Displays player names along with their corresponding teams.
Achievements:
•	Created a concise and efficient football player assignment program in Python.
•	Demonstrated proficiency in OOP and randomization techniques.
•	Achieved balanced and fair team distributions, showcasing strong problem-solving skills.
